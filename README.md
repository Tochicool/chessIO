# chessIO -- A Haskell chess library and console UCI frontend program

chessIO is a Haskell library for working with chess positions and moves, and a
console frontend program (cboard) to work with UCI compatible chess engines.

## Library

The main module provided by the library is Game.Chess_, which defines
data types and functions for working with chess positions and moves.
It offers a fully compliant move generator and parsing for and printing
positions in `Forsyth-Edwards Notation`_ and moves in `Algebraic Notation`_.

Module Game.Chess.UCI_ provides functionality to run an external process
which understands the Universal Chess Interface protocol from within Haskell.

## cboard

cboard is a simple console (text-mode) frontend for interacting with chess engines
(like stockfish or glaurung) which make use of the UCI protocol.
Think simple replacement for XBoard for console users.
